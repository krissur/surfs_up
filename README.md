## Overview
For this project I was assigned the task of analyzing weather data in Oahu. I have received data from a multitude of weather stations over several months to help determine if a surf shop in Oahu could be successful in this area based on climate statistics.


## Results
As shown below in the June and December statistic images, I have received information from between 1,517 and 1,700 stations and the temperatures are relatively consistent with modest variations.

Temperature Comparisons

* Lows - fluctuate by 8 degrees 

* Highs - fluctuate by 2 degrees

* Averages - fluctuate by less then 4 degrees

## Summary
In comparing June and December, with the small amount of variation, we can conclude that there are 6 months of average temperatures of 70 + degrees. Weather looks enjoyable for much of the year based on this data.

To support this decision, I would suggest 2 additional queries
1)	Analyzing the peak tourist vacation months throughout the USA and Hawaii. 
2)	Analyze the Tsunami and Hurricane data in Oahu for at least 12months.
